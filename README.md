While coefficient input is fairly straightforward, equation input might pose more challenges.

You can utilize the `^` symbol to represent the exponentiation operation

You can choose whether to include the `*` multiplication symbol or not.

Example input / output:

```
x^2 - 5x + 12 = 5x^2 + x - 5

Two real roots were found!
x1 = -2.94374
x2 = 1.44374
